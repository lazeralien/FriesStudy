# FriesStudy
A statistical analysis to evaluate what is the profile of a French fry at various stores

If using R for the first time install R at https://cran.r-project.org/
This is used in R Studio though it will likely work in other IDEs

I'm making the assumption you already have R and RStudio installed. Tidyverse will need to be installed in RStudio to run some of the code.



Install Git

In Git:
go to git bash and type each line with your info replacing John Doe

git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com


In RStudio:
To start go to File > New Project > Version Control > Git
https://github.com/lazeralien/FriesStudy.git

Before working on project go to Tools > Version Control > Pull Branches

To save work go to Tools > Version Control > Commit
  click "staged" for all files  
  put something in message
  then select push (top right arrow)
